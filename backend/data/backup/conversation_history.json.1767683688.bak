    "content": "Single‑agent systems keep all logic in one brain—fast, simple, but they get stuck when tasks grow complex or need specialization.  \nMulti‑agent setups split the job into little specialists that talk to each other—more flexible and scalable, but you pay the price of coordination overhead and a bit more latency.  \nSo, pick one when you’re shipping a quick prototype, and go multi‑agent when the problem really needs teamwork."
