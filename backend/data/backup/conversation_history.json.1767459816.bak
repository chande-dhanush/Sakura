    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "The email tool seems to be working just fine. Before Generative AI, people were building their personal assistants and chatbots using rule-based systems, decision trees, and machine learning algorithms like supervised and unsupervised learning. They relied heavily on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization, named entity recognition, and intent identification.\n\nDevelopers used frameworks like AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) and programming languages like Python, Java, and C++ to create chatbots. They also utilized libraries and tools like NLTK, spaCy, and Stanford CoreNLP for NLP tasks.\n\nSome popular platforms for building chatbots included IBM Watson, Microsoft Bot Framework, and Rasa. These platforms provided pre-built functionalities and APIs that made it easier to develop conversational interfaces.\n\nIt's interesting to see how far we've come, and now with Generative AI, building personal assistants and chatbots has become even more accessible and efficient. What do you think about the current state of AI-powered chatbots, Dhanush?"
