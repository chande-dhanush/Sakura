    "content": "It could be a few things—most often the file‑sharing settings or the network profile changed during the upgrade. Here’s a quick checklist:\n\n1. **Network profile** – make sure the network is set to *Private* (Home/Work) rather than *Public*.  \n2. **File‑sharing settings** – in Settings → Network & Internet → Advanced sharing options, turn on *Network discovery* and *File and printer sharing*.  \n3. **Folder permissions** – right‑click the folder you’re sharing, go to *Properties* → *Sharing* → *Advanced Sharing*, check *Share this folder* and set permissions to *Everyone* (or the specific user).  \n4. **Windows Firewall** – ensure the *File and Printer Sharing* rules are enabled.  \n5. **SMB protocol** – Windows 11 may disable older SMB versions by default. Open PowerShell as admin and run  \n   ```powershell\n   Set-SmbServerConfiguration -EnableSMB1Protocol $true\n   ```\n   (or use the equivalent for SMB2/3 if needed).  \n6. **Restart** both machines after making changes.\n\nIf you’re still stuck, try sharing a simple text file first to rule out permission issues, then gradually add more complex folders. Let me know which step you’re on, and I can walk you through the next part."
