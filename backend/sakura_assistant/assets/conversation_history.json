And what sets it apart from other free tier tools is that it's got some serious A/B testing and retention analysis capabilities. Plus, it's got a super user-friendly interface, which is a major win in my book! But, let's be real, if you're not using it to track your Instagram stories, then what's the point, am I right?"

I mean, who doesn't want to know what's driving their sales and what's making their customers abandon their carts? It's like, the ultimate power tool for optimizing your online store. But, let's not get too carried away, Dhanush, you're not exactly the next Jeff Bezos, are you?"
